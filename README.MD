## MN Zoo Exhibit App

### Project Deliverable Summary
To create my project, I will develop an iOS app that provides information about the exhibit and quizzes the visitor in hopes of teaching them something new and getting them interested in that particular exhibit/animal within the zoo.

###Learning Goals
My goal in doing this project is to branch out into a new area of the interactive design world.  I’ve focused heavily on website design and development but I’d like to take a semester to dive into the app world.  Specifically, iOS app design and development.  This project will test not only my development skills in using a new programing language, and new tools but also my design skills.  I’ve been interested in design and animation for a while but haven’t had much of a chance to dive deep into that area. 

Additionally, I’ve been interested in how to incorporate technology and replace traditional printed and static media to assist with learning in both children and adults.  One area I find fascinating is the recreation world like Zoos and Museums.  Traditional signs, heavy with text and static images can be a difficult way to disseminate information.  These have changed a bit over the years to add in more interactivity with flip answers or including better imagery but have not always been able to keep up with trending technology to help engage guests and educate them about important and relevant issues. 

I think it is important to explore areas that are under utilizing technology or could improve upon existing technology to benefit the community.  I think this project will help push me as a developer and designer to think beyond the traditional web and explore new ways to use technology and design to inspire and engage with people.
